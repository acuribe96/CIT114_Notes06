**CIT114 - Notes 06, Compute**

*EC2*

- provides virtual machines where you can host the same applications
- provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud

*Amazon Machine Image (AMI)*

- template that is used to create an EC2
- contains Windows or Linux operating system

*Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)*

- durable, block-level storage volumes

*Amazon EC2 Instance Store*

- storage is provided on disks that are attached to the host comuter where the EC2 instance is running

*Tag*

- a label that you can assign to AWS resource
- it is how you can attach metadata to an EC2 instance

*Security Group*

- set of firewall rules that control traffic to the instance

*Key Pair*

- enables secure connections to the instance
- consits of a public key that AWS stores and a private key that you store

*Container*

- method of operating system virtualization

*Amazon ECS*

- highly scalable, fast, container management service

*Kubernetes*

- open source software for container orchestration

*Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service*

- Enables you to rub Kubernetes on AWS
- manages clusters of Amazon EC2 compute instances

*Amazon Elastic Container Registry*

- makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images

*AWS Lambda* 

- a serverless compute service

*AWS Elastic Beanstalk*

- easy way to get web applications up and running
- no additional charge

**Question 2**
>Running servers on premises is expensive, servers must be purchased, data centers must be built, staffed and mainted.

- I watched a video where a company would spent millions a year for their data centers and servers. When I did a practice on building an Cloud infrastructure, it costed less than a million.

>It manages the fleet of nodes, or EC2 instances, that run your containers, removing the complexity of managing the infrastructure yourself.

- For this line it is talking about Amazon ECS, it is cool how much it helps with your containers without you fully managing it on your own.

 **Question 4**
- Is there a way to know which kind of applications to use and will help with what you want to run?
